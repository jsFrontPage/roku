This directory represents source and configuration files for an Android app that emulates a Roku RSP remote.

In addition, the app can transmit various sensor readings (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) from a suitably equipped Android device to the Roku RSP.

Also, touch and multi-touch events were added from a blank screen called "touch" (as opposed to "buttons"). The touch/button mode is togglable via standard settings.

All of this input is communicated to the Roku RSP via the roku:rsp:ecp protocol which is presented by the Roku RSP and discovered by this Android app as an SSDP service.

The Roku directory is the root of an Eclipse IDE project. It has been succesfully imported from a simple file hierarchy into Eclipse at least once.

To use it successfully, there are several required installation steps. Eclipse must be installed. The Android SDK must be installed, and several Android plugins must be installed into Eclipse.

To get Eclipse to see the target, I have to use the adb (Android Debug bridge) tool to kill the adb server "adb kill-server" and re-scan for devices "adb devices" after connecting the target to the host via USB but before starting Eclipse. After that, selecting "Run -> Debug" would download the Roku Remote app to the target and run it in debug mode.

Web research will eventually reveal all the steps, but be prepared for some missteps. Please feel free to update this doc with additional detail or new install and usage scenarios.

This was tested hosted on Fedora 12 (Constantine) with Eclipse 3.5 (Galileo) and targeted to the Samsung Galaxy S Tab running Android 2.2 (Froyo).

In its present form, this app requires Android 2.2 (API 8) at minimum. By removing or stubbing the Touch class, Android 1.6 (API 4) will suffice.
